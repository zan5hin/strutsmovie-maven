This is a sandbox application originally created in Struts 1 as a learning exercise.

In this form it will be converted to Struts 2, the build process switched from Ant to Maven 2, and EJB 3 used
for the persistence layer.

Oh, and git (via Github) will be used as the version control in order to learn that as well.

Finally, IntelliJ IDEA is being used at the IDE.

All kinds of fun.
